## 💡 Key Features
The following features made what gSubs is today and many more features will be, hopefully added with the support of great open source community in the future.
</br>
</br>
#### Drag & Drop
Just drag and drop the video files that you want to search subtitle for and gSubs will do it's job. No more browsing and selecting videos from the mysteries directories that you don't know.

#### Multiple Files
gSubs supports multiple files input, meaning you can drag and drop as many files as you want and gSubs will find subtitles for each and every file. You have an entire season with dozen of episodes? gSubs gets your subtitles for the entire season in one time.

#### Search Subtitles
You don't have a video file but just want to donwload your favourite movies or series subtitles? Don't worry, gSubs consists of the search function where you can input any queries for search. gSubs will give you the results according to the language that has been set.

#### 10 Languages
gSubs are capable of finding you subtitles for 10 languages which are English, Español, Français, Italiano, Nederlands, Polski, Português, Român, Svenska and Türkçe. Many more languages will be added soon.

#### Auto Update
gSubs have auto update feature included in it. This means you don't have to manually download the latest release every time. gSubs downloads and installs the latest release automatically.
